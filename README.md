# Simple Competitions - java final project

This project was cloned from a private repository and was a submission as the final project in a introductory java programming subject at The University of Melbourne.

This program is a terminal application that helps companies create competitions to boost their sales. For instance, during the Easter period, a retail store can use this program software to create a lucky draw game. 

In the game, a customer is given entries equivalent to the size of its purchase after their single-purchase final balance, after discounts, reaces a specic amount. Once the competition time ends, the retailer draws winners and the winning customers will get points added to their membership account; customers can use these points for future purchases if they wish.

## Run the program

'''
> cd ~/src
> javac SimpleCompetitions.java
> java SimpleCompetitions
'''

The program can load a saved competition from file.

The program is also able to be run in a testing mode or in a normal mode. The testing mode is designed in such a way to test the program in a deterministic manner.
